## Question 1: _Who is your favorite Turing award winner?_

## Answer:
Barbara Liskov. When I read historical CS papers, I often get this magical feeling where I
appreciate how ideas I take for granted had to be _invented_ by someone. No where was this
feeling more apparent than when reading through Liskov's seminal paper *"Data Abstraction and
Hierarchy."* It's like reading about English from the person who invented English grammar (if
English grammar had any semblance of the elegance of a well-designed object-oriented design
pattern). Was this eloquent enough? Did I get all of the points?

## Question 2: _What is your favorite code annotation tool?_

## Answer:

GitHub is pretty cool...actually I'm going to go with codePost here. Why?
* It's pretty cool that you can deduct points directly from comments
* Comments can linked to rubric items
* Dark mode...

I'm just a student, but I can imagine these features makes life much easier for my instructors.
Also it's neat how I can leave feedback on feedback. Sometimes a rubric comment just doesn't make
sense, ya know?
